Customer Churn Prediction System
A machine learning project designed to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the service) based on features such as contract type, charges, tenure, and more. The system uses multiple models, advanced preprocessing techniques, and visualizations to provide actionable business insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a predictive machine learning system that classifies customers based on their likelihood to churn, and provides visual and statistical insights for reducing churn.

ðŸ§  Key Features
Preprocessing of real-world telecom customer data

Class imbalance handled using SMOTE

Feature engineering with new interaction terms

Model training using:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost

Voting Classifier (Ensemble)

Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

Visualizations for data analysis and model evaluation

SHAP interpretability for explaining model predictions

ðŸ“¦ Dataset
Source: Kaggle or UCI repository

Attributes: customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, tenure, Contract, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Churn, and more.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Seaborn, Matplotlib

SHAP (for explainability)

SMOTE (for imbalance handling)

ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations
Incentivize long-term contracts to reduce month-to-month churners.

Focus on retention during the first 6 months of customer tenure.

Monitor high-bill customers and offer personalized plans.

Improve customer service for users with frequent support calls.

Integrate churn prediction into your CRM for real-time alerts.
